<h1>PMDCI'S FLAGS PACK</h1>
<h4> Version 2.1.1 [2012-Jun-25]<br />
  By <a href="http://www.pedroinnecco.com">Pedro Innecco</a></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT</strong></h3>
<p align="left">These flag icons has been compiled and formated by Pedro Innecco (that's me!). I am a flag-enthusiast (a hobbyist 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology">vexillologist</a>, the one who study flags) and I've been studying flags since I was four years old. I guess the 
colourful pictures just captivated me as a child.</p>
<p>This pack contain the flags of all countries, territories, or areas of geographical interest that meet the criteria for inclusion in the ISO <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO3166-1</a> standard.</p>

<h3><strong>USAGE</strong></h3>
<p>These flags were designed to be used within applications as a way to represent countries and regions. For example, upon selecting a country/region from a drop-down list, in reports and dashboards, tables which contain columns depicting a location (e.g.: a user list in a community portal, or in user profile pages), and so on. This pack has been used with several different applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0, 2011</li>
  <li>Microsoft SharePoint 2007, 2010</li>
  <li>Blogs and Content Management Systems such as Drupal, Joomla, Xaraya and Wordpress</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>POLITICS</strong></h3>
<p>If you feel that a given flag is not appropriate, feel free to replace it by following the guidelines below. But please bear in mind that the author is not interested to engage in political debates and would like to stay as neutral as possible about flags and territorial disputes. Moreover, if you would like to make any <strong>POLITE</strong> suggestions, please contact the author directly.</p>
<h3><strong>FLAGS GUIDELINES</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IMAGE SIZE:</strong> All flags must follow their correspondent <strong>official</strong> scale, and be 16 pixels in height.</li>
  <li><strong>IMAGE FORMAT:</strong> All flags must be on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG">PNG</a> format.</li>
  <li><strong>NOMENCLATURE:</strong> All files are originally named as <code>flag_xx.png</code>, where <code>xx</code> is the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO3166-1</a> Alpha-2 code for the country or region. For example, <code>flag_ch.png</code> for Switzerland and <code>flag_br.png</code> for Brazil and so on. Additionally, a file called <b><code>flag_aa.png</code></b> is included so you can use for when there is no Country selected from a given Country/Region list. Starting with version 2.0, the pack includes a script file named FLAGPACK-MV.CMD that can be executed from the command prompt of any Microsoft Windows system (XP or superior) that will allow the renaming of flag icon files between the ISO3166-1 Alpha-2 code (two-letter country code) or the ISO3166-1 Numerical code.</li>
